# Pokemon List app using React.js and free API endpoint
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application uses a free API endpoint to fetch the Pokemon list.<br>
The app also has a function to search for a specific Pokemon from the Pokemon list using the input field.<br>
Additionally, clicking on a specific Pokemon will display additional information about that Pokemon.
