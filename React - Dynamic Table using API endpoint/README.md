# App using the Google Books API endpoint to fetch data
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application retrieves information from the API endpoint to dynamically display the data in the table.<br>
In addition, the table has the function of clicking on the rows, pressing a specific row retrieves additional information about the selected book.<br>
The app also generates the clicked rows history by displaying a button with the clicked row's ID at the bottom, the button will take you back to the row with the specified ID.
