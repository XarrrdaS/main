# Simple Todo List app using React.js and Express.js
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, start the `server.js` express server `node server.js` and run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application uses a JSON file as the database and an Express server for API endpoints for the JSON file.<br>
The app also has the function to add and remove from the JSON file. <br>
Additionally, each time you delete or add Todo task, the app updates the ID row in the JSON file to make sure everything is in order.
