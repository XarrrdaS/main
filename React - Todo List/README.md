# Simple Todo List app using React.js and Express.js
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, start the `server.js` express server `node server.js` and run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application uses a JSON file as the database and an Express server for API endpoints for the JSON file.<br>
The app also has the function to add and remove from the JSON file. <br>
Additionally, each time you delete or add Todo task, the app updates the ID row in the JSON file to make sure everything is in order.

This is how the app looks like, very simple mechanism - very simple appearance.
