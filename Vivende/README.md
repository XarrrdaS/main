# One of my former tasks while I was on my internship in the Vivende

I upgraded their Website visually and in SEO. Also I added some new things like this form which can send multiple attachments at once and I configured appearance in the mailbox.<br>
However, I cannot upload here all those Website files, but I posted sourcecode of <b><i>Contact form</i></b> and <b><i>PHP mail sender</i></b><br>
Below I attached some more informations and link for their site.<br>
https://www.vivende.pl/<br><br>
Here's a screenshot of what the message from their site looks like in your mailbox:<br>
