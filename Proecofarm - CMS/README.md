# My own Content Management System
If you want to run my CMS, you need to enable the localhost and create the database called <i><b>`cms`</b></i> in mysqli.<br>
After that, you have to import tabels from <i><b>`Databases`</b></i> folder to the <i><b>`cms`</b></i> database in the mysqli.<br>
When you are ready, just run this site (http://localhost/Proecofarm%20-%20CMS/),<br>
if you want to enter my own CMS, you need to type <i><b>`/admin`</b></i> after the site address (http://localhost/Proecofarm%20-%20CMS/admin/).<br>
Default login: <i><b>admin</b></i><br>
Default password: <i><b>admin</b></i><br>
